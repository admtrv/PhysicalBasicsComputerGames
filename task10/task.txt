A block of mass m is initially placed at rest on a frictional inclined plane with angle α to the horizontal. A constant pulling force F_pull is applied along the plane, causing the block to accelerate upward. The coefficient of friction between the block and the plane is μ, and gravity acts with acceleration g. Determine the force acting on the block and the resulting acceleration a as it moves along the incline. Simulate the motion of the block over time, starting from rest, and compute its position, speed, and displacement along the incline. Use coordinate transformations to obtain the global position of the block in space. Collect the simulation data into a file, to visualize them later using the gnuplot program.
