The first part of the route, 10 km long, was covered by a bus at a constant speed of v1 = 70 km/h, and it stopped at a bus stop for 60 seconds. The second part of the route, 12 km long, was covered at a speed of v2 = 60 km/h. What was the average speed of the bus? Additionally, the calculated average speed from the physical formula should be compared with the actual average speed obtained from the simulation. Moreover, the simulation data should be collected into a file and then plotted using gnuplot.
