At an intersection, a car stopped at a red light, and the neighboring lane is free. At the moment when the light turns green, the car starts accelerating at a constant speed. At the same time, a bus overtakes it in the neighboring lane, moving at a constant speed. In what time will the passenger car catch up with the bus? In addition, the time calculated from the physical formula should be compared with the actual time obtained from the simulation. In addition, the simulation data should be collected into a file and then plotted using the gnuplot program.
