Three objects start moving along a straight line near each other. The first object starts from the origin and moves in the positive direction. The second object starts at a distance from the origin, also moving in the positive direction. The third object starts from the opposite end and moves in the negative direction. Additionally, the simulation data should be collected into a file and then plotted using gnuplot.
