A block with mass m starts sliding down a smooth semicircular hill with radius R, beginning with an initial speed v0. As it moves along the curved surface, gravity causes it to accelerate, and the normal force decreases. When the normal force is no longer enough to keep the block on the circular path, it detaches from the surface and follows a free-fall trajectory through the air.
