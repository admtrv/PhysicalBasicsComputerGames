Two cars are moving towards each other along a straight line. The initial distance between them is 200 meters. The first car moves at a speed of 15 m/s, while the second car moves in the opposite direction at a speed of 10 m/s. It is required to implement a graphical simulation of their motion and determine the moment of collision. Additionally, the calculated collision time from the physical formula should be compared with the actual time obtained from the simulation.
