The drone was flying at an unknown height and released a package with zero initial velocity. At the same moment, a cannon located at a known horizontal distance d from the drone fired an ammo at a known angle αα with an initial speed V. Calculate the time it takes for the ammo to collide with the package. In addition, the data calculated from the physical formulas should be compared with the actual data obtained from the simulation. The simulation data should be collected into a file and then plotted using the gnuplot program.
