The driver spotted the police car and began to brake steadily. On a straight line of length L, he slowed down from speed v1 to speed v2. Determine the deceleration (acceleration) of the car. How long did the braking take? If the driver continues braking, in how long from the start of braking will the car stop ? What is the distance travelled by the car from the start of braking to coming to a complete stop. In addition, the data calculated from the physical formulas should be compared with the actual data obtained from the simulation. In addition, the simulation data should be collected into a file and then plotted using the gnuplot program.
