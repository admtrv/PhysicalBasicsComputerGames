Two objects start at the same height. The first object is thrown straight up with an initial speed at time zero. The second object stays at rest at the same height and is later thrown downward with a zero initial speed. Both objects fall under gravity without air resistance. Find the moment when the second object should be released so that both objects reach the ground at the same time. Additionally, the calculated time from the physical formula should be compared with the actual time obtained from the simulation.
