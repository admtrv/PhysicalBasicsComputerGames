A body is initially located on a circular path of radius r, starting from rest. It begins to rotate with a constant tangential acceleration e1, making n full revolutions before reaching a final angular velocity. Then it continues to rotate at that constant speed for exactly three full revolutions. Finally, the body decelerates with a constant tangential deceleration e2 until it comes to a complete stop.
